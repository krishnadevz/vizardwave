**vizardwave**
## Inspiration
First of all, what the name of the project tell us about, so **vizardwave** consist of vizard which is a synonym for mask and wave means hand gestures.  
Since childhood, we love to imagine comic superheroes and other cartoon characters that's why we choose this idea to implement. we had of few ideas in mind but we stuck to this because we thought this one is the best fit for the kids' category. and that is cool.
## What it does
Basically, this project firstly detects the hand gestures of users after allowing the camera access, and then with help of TensorFlow.js face-landmarks-detection library we detect the face to apply the mask and then after doing gestures(for that we finger pose) like thumbs up and down spiderman (ex ðŸ¤Ÿ) then according to that superhero sign image will be added to the users face and this is it for this project kind of cool/funny and built for kids/adult-kids:)
